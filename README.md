# Training a Single Perceptron

This repository demonstrates how to train a single perceptron on a synthetic dataset using Python. The implementation includes data normalization, weight and bias initialization, and iterative training to minimize classification error.

## Overview

A perceptron is a simple type of artificial neural network used for binary classification tasks. This project trains a perceptron using a provided training dataset and evaluates its accuracy on a test dataset.

Key features of this implementation:
- Data normalization for consistent input scaling
- Training with gradient-based updates to weights and biases
- Evaluation of classification accuracy on test data
- Modular design for reusability of key functions

## File Structure

- **`perceptron_solution.py`**: Contains the main implementation of the perceptron, including training, testing, and utility functions.
